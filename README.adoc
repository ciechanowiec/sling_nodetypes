== Overview

_Sling Node Types_ is a `jar` artifact that delivers a https://jackrabbit.apache.org/jcr/node-type-notation.html[CND file] with all node types and namespaces defined in https://sling.apache.org/[Apache Sling 12]. It can be used for the https://jackrabbit.apache.org/filevault/validation.html[FileVault Validation Module] and its `jackrabbit-nodetype` validator.

The functionality of _Sling Node Types_ is similar to https://github.com/Netcentric/aem-nodetypes[_AEM Node Types_] (`biz.netcentric.aem:aem-nodetypes`). However, unlike _AEM Node Types_, this program delivers a CND file exported directly from a clean Apache Sling 12 instance, without AEM-related code on the top of it.

== Usage

In order to use _Sling Node Types_, it should be added as a dependency of _Apache Jackrabbit FileVault Package Maven Plugin_. Additionally, a `sling.cnd` file should be defined within the `jackrabbit-nodetypes` validator. The file will be picked up during the build from the _Sling Node Types_ classpath:

                    <!-- use the nodetypes and namespaces from the sling-nodetypes.jar provided in the plugin dependencies -->
                    <cnds>tccl:sling.cnd</cnds>
                </options>
            </jackrabbit-nodetypes>

    </configuration>

            <version>${sling.nodetypes.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>

== Generation of CND

The CND file delivered by _Sling Node Types_ was exported from a running plain Apache Sling 12 instance through the https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-9945[JCR Web Console Plugin] via the endpoint `/system/console/status-JCR%20CND.txt`.
